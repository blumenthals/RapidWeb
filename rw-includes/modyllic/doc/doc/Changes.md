Revision history for PHP module Modyllic

v0.2.23 2014-01-06

* Static tables with null values will now compare correctly
* Comparing normalized types will now always use the right type while normalizing
* Add ability to issue alters individually for, eg, replicating 5.5->5.6

* Add facility for determining non-reserved keywords for highlighting purposes
* Only emit ROW_FORMAT when it differs from the default.
* Stop emitting IF EXISTS in ModyllicSQL

* Add examples to readme

v0.2.22 2013-11-27

v0.2.20 2013-10-22
